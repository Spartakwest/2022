    It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map. For a
    second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby
    cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of?

    Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road,
    he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats
    couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove
    toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.

    But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning
    traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in
    cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He
    supposed this was some stupid new fashion.

    He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
    They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all;
    why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!
